        <div class="section">
            <h2>About GlyphThoughts</h2>
            <p>I am Shantanu. On my 18th birthday, in darkness before dawn, GlyphThoughts was born: not as celebration,
                but necessity.</p>

            <p>I had always been drawn to philosophy's shadows, to words that heal invisible wounds. People found solace
                in conversations with me, drawn to something unnamed, perhaps darkness transformed into light for their
                benefit. Their gratitude became my burden, their healing my purpose.</p>

            <p>Then came the catalyst: the 2A Plus by Nothing. Its widgets contained forgotten wisdom. Profound thoughts
                abandoned by a distracted world. I saw treasure in the digital void, waiting for someone with vision
                dark enough to retrieve it.</p>

            <p>I began in silence, posting thoughts that cut through existence's noise. Each post rebelled against
                meaningless chatter drowning modern souls. Slowly, deliberately, I learned creation: reels with weight,
                content that mattered.</p>

            <p>Surface-level inspiration wasn't enough. I built something deeper: a website where the GT family: those
                brave enough to seek wisdom in darkness, could find substance. Here, philosophy meets technology in
                unprecedented ways. Projects emerge from code and contemplation, offering engagement beyond shallow
                platform interactions.</p>

            <p>Currently: expanding Stoic philosophy and interactive technology intersections, building tools making
                ancient wisdom accessible to minds drowning in digital noise.</p>

            <p>Three principles guide this work: Community: bound not by comfort but shared truth pursuit.
                Innovation: technology serves wisdom, not reverse. Growth: profound change comes through confronting
                what
                others avoid.</p>

            <p>When not coding or curating, I explore philosophical texts most fear, seeking ways to challenge and
                elevate followers.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Philosophy</h2>
            <p>This work's foundation draws from those who examined existence without comfort: Marcus Aurelius on
                impermanence, Seneca on resilience, Epictetus on control. But wisdom transcends single traditions. Here,
                ancient Stoicism meets modern psychology, Eastern mindfulness meets Western pragmatism. Result: tools
                for minds refusing easy answers.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Vision</h2>
            <p>GlyphThoughts creates what the world lacks: where ancient wisdom meets modern capability, where
                depth-seekers find it uncompromised.</p>

            <p>This isn't typical motivational content designed to make you feel better. This is wisdom crafted to make
                you think deeper, question harder, grow where comfort cannot provide. Each experience is personalized
                because true growth is individual. What transforms one soul may leave another unchanged.</p>

            <p>The mission evolves, as it must. What began as posts becomes something greater: a global network of minds
                unafraid to explore human existence's darker corners, finding light not by avoiding shadows, but
                understanding them.</p>

            <p>Welcome to the GT family. Here, growth isn't gentle.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Website Projects</h2>
            <p>Each project converges philosophical depth with technological precision. These aren't mere
                websites. They're digital experiences crafted to challenge, inspire, transform.</p>

            <p>Each serves purpose: interactive philosophical exercises challenging assumptions, coding tutorials
                merging technical skill with deeper thinking, community spaces where authentic discourse replaces
                shallow engagement. These aren't portfolio pieces. They're transformation instruments.</p>

            <p>Built from darkness, hosted in light. Every code line serves purpose deeper than functionality. Explore
                what happens when ancient wisdom meets modern implementation.</p>

            <h3>What is the GT family?</h3>
            <p>Not followers or subscribers: family. Those understanding growth requires discomfort, that wisdom lives
                between easy answers. We're bound by shared truth pursuit, not comfort.</p>

            <h3>Why the dark tone?</h3>
            <p>Surface-level positivity serves no one seeking real transformation. Darkness isn't the enemy: ignorance
                is. We explore what others avoid because authentic growth lives there.</p>

            <h3>How is this different from typical motivational content?</h3>
            <p>Most motivational content makes you feel better. This makes you think deeper. We don't offer comfort. We
                offer tools for those brave enough to question never-examined beliefs.</p>

            <h3>What should I expect from GlyphThoughts projects?</h3>
            <p>Discomfort. Challenge. Growth only coming from confronting avoidance. Each project pushes beyond shallow
                interactions dominating digital spaces.</p>

            <h3>Why isn't this page fancy like other websites?</h3>
            <p>This page was also created as a project (<a
                    href="https://github.com/glyphthoughts/About-Project-GlpyhThoughts" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
                    style="color: #ffffff; text-decoration: underline;">GitHub repository</a>). I wanted simplicity and
                minimalism,
                purely for knowing about me and the work. Complexity serves no one when substance is the goal.</p>

            <p>Fancy designs are distractions: animations serving ego over understanding, graphics competing with
                meaning, elements existing only to impress rather than inform. This simplicity is intentional: faster
                loading, clearer focus, no unnecessary mobile navigation noise.</p>

            <p>Design mirrors GlyphThoughts philosophy: stripping superfluity to reveal essence. Eliminating decoration
                gives remaining elements more weight. This isn't about lacking resources or skill; it's choosing
                substance over spectacle. Content should challenge thinking, not patience.</p>

            <p>True sophistication lies not in additions, but knowing what to remove. This page conveys information and
                facilitates connection: anything beyond interferes with that goal.</p>

            <h3>Is this suitable for everyone?</h3>
            <p>No. Only suitable if you genuinely want change: not just feeling better about staying the same. If you're
                content with current thinking patterns, prefer comfort over growth, seek validation over transformation,
                this isn't your destination. But if you're prepared to question fundamental beliefs, embrace difficult
                truths, undergo uncomfortable genuine change, welcome.</p>

            <h3>Have a Question Not Listed Here?</h3>
            <p>Profound inquiries often can't be anticipated. If your question cuts deeper than above, challenges the
                framework itself, or demands discourse beyond simple answers, reach through Instagram DMs.</p>

            <p>Direct message for genuine inquiry: questions emerging from serious content engagement, not casual
                curiosity. Ask what others might hesitate to voice.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Suggestions</h2>
            <p>Wisdom emerges from dialogue, not monologue. Your insights matter: not because all opinions are equal,
                but because true innovation requires perspectives I cannot see alone.</p>

            <p>Share what challenges you, what this project lacks, what it could become through Instagram DMs. This
                isn't for praise or surface feedback. This is for those seeing deeper, thinking harder, daring to
                suggest what others might fear voicing.</p>
